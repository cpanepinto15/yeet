knifechoose.nut
===============

First person knife model CSGO server-side script.

Installation
------------

Copy the `knifechoose.nut` into your `<csgo_directory>\csgo\scripts\vscripts` folder.

On Windows this is usually:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\csgo\scripts\vscripts

Usage
-----

Type `script_execute knifechoose` in the console and follow instructions.

For further instructions read the file itself. It can be opened with any text editor (examples: Notepad++, Notepad, Akelpad etc.).

Also don't be afraid to use [Issues Section](https://github.com/serkas001/knifechoose.nut/issues) to give me suggestions or point out bugs.

Detailed description
--------------------

The script allows you to use any standard knives models. The script is server-side so you can only use it in single-player or in private matches with friends. Also the script is working only for the round it was activated (at least till I find a way to avoid it :c).

Originally I made it for me and my friends/team for our team trainings, but later on decided to share it with people. I hope you enjoy! And don't forget to write your opinion in comments.
